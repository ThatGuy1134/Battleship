# Battleship

Another project from JetBrains Academy. If I was to do it all over again, 
I probably would have most of the methods for placing ships in a seperate
class. The project was done in stages, so it didn't make much sense to
completely start over.

For a future revision, I would let the player know which ship they sank.
Also, it would be nice to make it so that each player's board comes up in
a new window. Maybe JOptionPane
